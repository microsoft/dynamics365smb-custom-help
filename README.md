**IMPORTANT**
The tools from this toolkit have been deprecated. The language-specific repositories for the Business Central documentation are also being deprecated, and will no longer be available after the end of 2022.

If you would like to generate HTML files from the Markdown files in the English repository for the Business Central documentation, use a tool such as MkDocs or Docusaurus.
